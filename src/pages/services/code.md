I'm well versed in crafting clean semantic HTML5, CSS3/Sass and JavaScript (plus libraries like jQuery, React and application frameworks like AngularJS).

My code fits in with your existing coding standards and style guides, I've worked in several development environments such as LAMP, Node, Ruby on Rails and Java all utilising Git version control.
